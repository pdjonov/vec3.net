This is the source for [my personal website](https://vec3.net), which is mostly just a rambly blog.

The site consists of nothing but static content, most of which is authored using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). That is then transformed into the final site resources by a relatively simple site generator project, which you'll also find in this repo.

No, this is not a product that I'm wrapping up and selling or redisributing or anything like that. But the code in the `SiteGen/` directory _is_ free and you're welcome to fork it to suit your own needs.

The stuff in the `Content/` folder is all Copyright Â© Philip Djonov, and all rights are reserved. (Also it's probly full of typos and people will make fun of you for trying to steal the typos.)

# SiteGen

The site generator is a relatively simple (though not what I'd call archecturally _beautiful_) program.

It is loosely inspired by _other_ Razor-powered static site generators, but it isn't a fork or clone of any of them. It does its own thing in its own way.

I will give credit, however, to [Statiq](https://www.statiq.dev/). I ultimately abandoned it because it's just _so_ much more than I require for my little site and I kept getting lost in its API and feature set while trying to make it behave the way _I_ want. But it _was_ the project that really proved to me that this would be a viable approach and, if my site wasn't so darn trivial, I'd probably have bit the bullet and figured it out. Props to the Statiq devs.

## Features

Pages can be authored either as Markdown or using Razor.

Razor layout templates (`_layout.cshtml`) can be used to apply site-wide structure and theming.

Automatically minifies the resulting HTML. Also minifies CSS and _sometimes_ JavaScript. (JS is only minified if you opt-_in_ on a per-file basis since [NUglify](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUglify) is _kinda_ [buggy](https://github.com/trullock/NUglify/issues/363) if you throw certain JS constructs at it, and the maintainers don't seem to care.)

You can dynamically generate pages by [enumerating](Content/posts/tags.cshtml) over the ones already stored on disk:
```csharp
@enumerate IGrouping<string, (MarkdownPage Page, PostFrontMatter FrontMatter)> Tag
{
	Items = Project.Content.GetPosts().ByTag();
	OutputPath = t => Posts.TagPath(t.Key);
}
```

There's not _a lot_ else here. This was built to be what _I_ need it to be, and I happen to have modest needs.

## Overall flow

The site generator runs roughly as follows:

1. Enumerate the source content files.
2. Compile any `.cs` files into a DLL that'll be used to configure HTML generation.
3. Compile any Razor (`.cshtml`) files which _do not_ begin with an underscore (`_`).
4. Initialize all pages:
   1. If any of the compiled Razor pages implement the special [`IEnumeratedContent`](SiteGen/Generator/ContentItem.cs#L215) interface, they are set aside.
   2. Give every other page a chance to initialize itself. This generally involves:
      * Parsing any front matter.
      * Figuring out what the output path should be.
   3. Go back through the set-aside `IEnumeratedContent` pages, initialize them, and have each generate _more_ pages.
   4. Repeat the initialization process with the newly generated pages.
5. Ask each page to prepare its contents.
   * This is generally where HTML is generated and where blurbs are extracted from that HTML.
   * Minification may be applied here.
   * If pages reference one another then preparing one page may cause another to also be prepared. This is fine, the preparation logic only ever runs once.
6. Have each page write its contents to disk.
   * If minification wasn't part of the preparation phase it's done here.
7. Delete any files left over in the output directory from an earlier run.

## Build and run

There's a VSCode workspace file in the project. In order to speed up iteration times, restoring NuGet packages is split apart from the main build task, so you'll need to:

1. Run the `restore` task once (and again each time you change `PackageReference`s).
2. Run the `build (SiteGen)` task (should be hooked to the default build keybinding).
3. Run with the `Run SiteGen` launch.
4. Publish the `Content/.out` folder in whatever way is appropriate for your hosting provider. I have not checked in my publish script for, well, _reasons_. You'll have to make your own.
