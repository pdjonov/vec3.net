My name's Phill Djonov, and I'm [a video game programmer](about/career/).

Sometimes I write code (and a little bit of it even makes it onto [GitHub](https://github.com/pdjonov)). Sometimes I solder microcontrollers to LED strips. Sometimes (rarely - *too* rarely) I even write stuff here.

This site's a little broken right now. Sorry about that. As far as I can tell, my old hosting provider was, uh, _unhappy_ to discover that they'd given me a really good indefinite promotional rate (or something like that) which I'd held onto for longer than _they_ intended, so I'm rebuilding it bit by bit in my spare time on Azure. Good times.

No, none of this content was produced by LLM. Spelling errors and excessively long sentences are all my own. I don't have a proofreader and figuring out how to integrate a spell checker into the (still very awkward) workflow behind this site is still on my to-do list.

### Contact

I can *sometimes* be reached at <phill@vec3.net>, but absolutely **never** on social media. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pdjonov/) exists in a superposition of being social media and being not social media.
